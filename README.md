🚀 Live backend server deployed on Render:

https://klasmeyt-your-friendly-tropa.onrender.com

⚠️ Note: Render's free tier has a 512MB RAM limit, which may cause errors like:
(Ran out of memory (used over 512MB) while running your code.)
If this happens, you can:
  *Re-deploy it to a local server (recommended for development)
  *Upgrade to a paid Render plan
  *Or deploy to another host like Railway, Vercel, etc.

🧪 Running Locally
If you want to run the app with a local backend, go to:
  *lib/services/chat_webService.dart
  *_socket = WebSocket(Uri.parse("ws://10.0.2.2:8000/ws/chat"));
